Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. Server forms the listener socket while client reaches out to the server.

They are the real backbones behind web browsing. In simpler terms there is a server and a client.

Socket programming is started by importing the socket library and making a simple socket.

Here we made a socket instance and passed it two parameters. The first parameter is AF_INET and the second one is SOCK_STREAM. AF_INET refers to the address family ipv4. The SOCK_STREAM means connection oriented TCP protocol.

========================================================

#!/bin/python3

import socket

HOST = '127.0.0.1'
PORT = 7777

# AF_INET : IPv4
# SOCK_STREAM: Port

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) 
s.connect((HOST, PORT))


# Before running this script we can listening the Port from different terminal with following Command

┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nc -nvlp 7777       
listening on [any] 7777 ...
connect to [127.0.0.1] from (UNKNOWN) [127.0.0.1] 58256
